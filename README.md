# Phoenix 1.3 with Bulma 0.6.2 and Font Awesome 4.7

This is an example of using Elixir Phoenix with Bulma.  There's a basic Bulma starter template being used. The main changes to the default install is in /assets/package.json, /assets/brunch-config.js, and /assets/css/* (namely that app.css was renamed to app.scss and some custom css was imported).

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
